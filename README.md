Gulf Stream Microbiomes
=====================
This repository contains open-source code, data, & text files for the gulf stream microbiomes project

Project: Characterizing microbial community composition associated with Sargassum communities

Raw sequence files can be found at NCBI SRA BioProject ID ().

## Goals

* **Aim 1)**: Characterize patterns of microbial community composition (bacterioplankton, microeukaryotes) associated with Sargassum compared to no Sargassum waters

## Contents
* **analyses:**: An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Mario Muscarella, Jo Werba, Alexandra Stucy, and Ariane Peralta containing functions used in analysis of soil and microbial sequence data.

* **bin:** 
	* *MothurTools.R*: An R script written by Mario Muscarella. R script contains functions used in the analysis of community sequence data.

* **data:**: Files associated with soil and microbial data sets. 

* **figures:**: Figures (of zooplankton and bacterioplankton structure and function) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.

* **mothur:**: Files containing script for bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Illumina MiSeq platform) using mothur pipeline.
